## Overview

Ignition Transport is an open source project based on the Apache License
Version 2.0, and is maintained by hardworking developers for everyone's benefit.
If you would like to contribute software patches, read on to find out how.
You'll probably want to check out the [Development
Section](https://ignitionrobotics.org/api/transport/7.0/tutorials.html) for
learning about the internal design of the library when planning your
contribution.

## Development process

We follow a development process designed to reduce errors, encourage
collaboration, and make high quality code. The process may seem rigid
and tedious, but every step is worth the effort (especially if you like
applications that work).

### Steps to follow


1.  Are you sure? Has your idea already been done, or maybe someone is
    already working on it?

    Check the [issue
    tracker](https://bitbucket.org/ignitionrobotics/ign-transport).

2. [Fork Ignition
   Transport](https://bitbucket.org/ignitionrobotics/ign-transport/fork). This
   will create your own personal copy of the project. All of your development
   should take place in your fork.

3.  Work out of a branch:

        hg branch my_new_branch_name

    Always work out of a new branch, never off of default. This is a good habit
    to get in, and will make your life easier. If you're solving an issue, make
    the branch name `issue_` followed by the issue number. E.g.:`issue_23`.

4.  Write your code.

    This is the fun part.

5.  Write tests.

    A pull request will only be accepted if it has tests. See the Test coverage
    section below for more information.

6.  Compiler warnings.

    Code must have zero compile warnings. This currently only applies to Linux.

7.  Style.

    A tool is provided to check for correct style. Your code must have no errors
    after running the following command from the root of the source tree:

        sh tools/code_check.sh

    The tool does not catch all style errors. See the Style section below for
    more information.

8.  Tests pass.

    There must be no failing tests. You can check by running `make test` in your
    build directory.

9.  Documentation.

    Document all your code. Every class, function, member variable must have
    doxygen comments. All code in source files must have documentation that
    describes the functionality. This will help reviewers, and future
    developers.

10. Review your code.

    Before submitting your code through a pull request, take some time to review
    everything line-by-line. The review process will go much faster if you make
    sure everything is perfect before other people look at your code. There is a
    bit of the human-condition involved here. Folks are less likely to spend time
    reviewing your code if it's bad.

11. Small pull requests.

    A large pull request is hard to review, and will take a long time. It  is
    worth your time to split a large pull request into multiple smaller pull
    requests. For reference, here are a few examples:

    - [Small, very nice](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/pull-request/1732)
    - [Medium, still okay](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/pull-request/1700)
    - [Too large](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/pull-request/30)

12. [Pull
    request](https://bitbucket.org/ignitionrobotics/ign-transport/pull-request/new).

    Submit a pull request when you ready.

13. Review.

    At least two other people have to approve your pull request before it can be
    merged. Please be responsive to any questions and comments.

14. Done, phew.

    Once you have met all the requirements, you're code will be merged. Thanks
    for improving Ignition Transport!

### Internal Developers

This section is targeted mostly for people who have commit access to the main
repositories.

In addition to the general development process, please follow these steps before
submitting a pull request. Each step is pass/fail, where the test or check must
pass before continuing to the next step.

1.  Run the style checker on your personal computer.
2.  Run all tests on your personal computer.
3.  Run your branch through a jenkins [trusty
    build](http://build.osrfoundation.org/view/main/view/ignition/job/ignition_transport-ci-pr_any-trusty-amd64/).
4.  Run your branch through a jenkins [homebrew
    build](http://build.osrfoundation.org/view/main/view/ignition/job/ignition_transport-ci-pr_any-homebrew-amd64/).
5.  Run your branch through a jenkins [windows 7
    build](http://build.osrfoundation.org/view/main/view/ignition/job/ignition_transport-ci-pr_any-windows7-amd64/).
6. Submit the pull request, and include the following:

    1.  Link to a passing [trusty
        build](http://build.osrfoundation.org/view/main/view/ignition/job/ignition_transport-ci-pr_any-trusty-amd64/).
    2.  Link to a passing [homebrew
        build](http://build.osrfoundation.org/view/main/view/ignition/job/ignition_transport-ci-pr_any-homebrew-amd64/).
    3.  Link to a passing [windows7
        build](http://build.osrfoundation.org/view/main/view/ignition/job/ignition_transport-ci-pr_any-windows7-amd64/).

7.  A set of jenkins jobs will run automatically once the pull request is
    created. Reviewers can reference these automatic jobs and the jenkins jobs
    listed in your pull request.

### Style

In general, we follow [Google's style
guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). However, we add in
some extras.

<b>\`\`this\`\` pointer</b>

  All class attributes and member functions must be accessed using the `this->`
  pointer. Here is an
  [example](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/default/%20gazebo/physics/Base.cc#cl-40).

<b>Underscore function parameters</b>

  All function parameters must start with an underscore. Here is an
  [example](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/default/gazebo/physics/Base.cc#cl-77).

<b>Do not cuddle braces</b>

  All braces must be on their own line. Here is an
  [example](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/default/gazebo/physics/Base.cc#cl-131).

<b>Multi-line code blocks</b>

  If a block of code spans multiple lines and is part of a flow control
  statement, such as an `if`, then it must be wrapped in braces. Here is an
  [example](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/default/gazebo/physics/Base.cc#cl-249)

<b>++ operator</b>

  This occurs mostly in `for` loops. Prefix the `++` operator, which is
  [slightly more efficient than postfix in some
  cases](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/59880/avoid-postfix-increment-operator).

<b>PIMPL/Opaque pointer</b>

  If you are writing a new class, it must use a private data pointer. Here is an
  [example](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/default/gazebo/physics/World.hh?at=default#cl-479),
  and you can read more
  [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer).

<b>const functions</b>

  Any class function that does not change a member variable should be marked as
  `const`. Here is an
  [example](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/default/gazebo/physics/Entity.cc?at=default#cl-175).

<b>const parameters</b>

  All parameters that are not modified by a function should be marked as
  `const`. This applies to parameters that are passed by reference, pointer, and
  value. Here is an
  [example](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/default/gazebo/physics/Entity.cc?at=default#cl-217).

<b>Pointer and reference variables</b>

  Place the `*` and `&` next to the variable name, not next to the type. For
  example: `int &variable` is good, but `int& variable` is not. Here is an
    [example](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/default/gazebo/physics/Entity.cc?at=default#cl-217).

<b>Camel case</b>

  In general, everything should use camel case. Exceptions include protobuf
  variable names.

<b>Class function names</b>

  Class functions must start with a capital letter, and capitalize every word.

  `void MyFunction();` : Good

  `void myFunction();` : Bad

  `void my_function();` : Bad

<b>Variable names</b>

  Variables must start with a lower case letter, and capitalize every word
  thereafter.

  `int myVariable;` : Good

  `int myvariable;` : Bad

  `int my_variable;` : Bad

### Reduce Code Duplication

Check to make sure someone else is not currently working on the same feature,
before embarking on a project to add something to Ignition Transport. Check the
[issue
tracker](https://bitbucket.org/ignitionrobotics/ign-transport/issues)
looking for issues with similar ideas.

### Write Tests

All code should have a corresponding unit test. Ignition Transport uses
[GTest](http://code.google.com/p/googletest) for unit testing.

#### Test coverage

The goal is to achieve 100% line and branch coverage. However, this is not
always possible due to complexity issues, analysis tools misreporting coverage,
and time constraints. Try to write as complete of a test suite as possible, and
use the coverage analysis tools as guide. If you have trouble writing a test
please ask for help in your pull request.

Ignition Transport has a build target called `make coverage` that will produce a
code coverage report. You'll need
[lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) installed.

1.  In your `build` folder, compile Ignition Transport with
    `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage`:

         cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage ..\
         make

2. Run a single test, or all the tests:

         make test

3. Make the coverage report:

         make coverage

4. View the coverage report:

         firefox coverage/index.html

## Debugging Ignition Transport

### Meaningful backtraces

In order to provide meaningful backtraces when using a debugger, such as GDB,
Ignition Transport should be compiled with debugging support enabled. When using
the ubuntu packages, specially the `-dbg` package, this support is limited but
could be enough in most of the situations. This are the three level of traces
which can be obtained:

<b>Maximum level of debugging support</b>

  This only can be obtained compiling Ignition Transport from source and setting
  the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `DEBUG`. This will set up no optimizations and
  debugging symbols. It can be required by developers in situations specially
  difficult to reproduce.

<b>Medium level of debugging support</b>

  This can be obtained installing the `libignition-transport7-dbg` package or
  compiling Ignition Transport from source using the `RELWITHDEBINFO`
  `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` mode (which is the default if no mode is provided). This
  will set up `-O2` optimization level but provide debugging symbols. This
  should be the default when firing up gdb to explore errors and submit traces.

<b>Minimum level of debugging support</b>

  This one is present in package versions (no `-dbg` package present) or
  compiling Ignition Transport from source using the `RELEASE`
  `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` option. This will set up the maximum level of optimizations
  and does not provide any debugging symbol information. This traces are
  particularly difficult to follow.

## Code Check

Code pushed into the repository should pass a few simple tests. It is also
helpful if patches submitted through bitbucket pass these tests. Passing these
tests is defined as generating no error or warning messages for each of the
following tests.

### Static Code Check

Static code checking analyzes your code for bugs, such as potential memory
leaks, and style. The Ignition Transport static code checker uses cppcheck, and
a modified cpplint. You'll need to install cppcheck on your system. Ubuntu users
can install via:

    sudo apt-get install cppcheck

To check your code, run the following script from the root of the Ignition
Transport sources:

    sh tools/code_check.sh

It takes a few minutes to run. Fix all errors and warnings until the
output looks like:

    Total errors found: 0
