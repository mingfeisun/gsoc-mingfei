## Build and Install

## Run

Ignition Launch is a system that runs and manages plugins and programs. A
configuration script can be used to specify which programs and plugins to
run. Alternatively, individual programs and plugins can be run from the
command line. Example configuration scripts are located in the `examples`
directory.

**Example**

1. Run a configuration that launches [Gazebo](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/gazebo).

    ```
    ign launch gazebo.ign
    ```
